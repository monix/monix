This is the API documentation for the [[https://www.monix.io Monix]] library.

==Overview==

Monix is a high-performance Scala / Scala.js library for
composing asynchronous and event-based programs using observable sequences
that are exposed as asynchronous streams, expanding on the
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern observer pattern]],
strongly inspired by
[[http://reactivex.io/ Reactive Extensions (Rx)]],
but designed from the ground up  for back-pressure and made to cleanly interact
with Scala's standard library and compatible out-of-the-box with the
[[http://www.reactive-streams.org/ Reactive Streams]] protocol.

Highlights:

  - zero dependencies
  - clean and user-friendly API, with the observer interface using `Future` for back-pressure purposes
  - Observable operators exposed in a way that's idiomatic to Scala
  - compatible with for-comprehensions
  - compatible with [[https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz Scalaz]]
  - designed to be completely asynchronous - Rx operators that are
    blocking or that are not compatible with back-pressure semantics
    are not going to be supported
  - does not depend on any particular mechanism for asynchronous
    execution and can be made to work with threads, actors, event loops,
    or whatnot, running perfectly both on top of the JVM or in Node.js
    or the browser
  - really good test coverage as a project policy

==Example Usage==

In order for subscriptions to work, we need an implicit
[[monix.execution.Scheduler Scheduler]] imported in our
context. A `Scheduler` inherits from Scala's own
[[http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/index.html#scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext ExecutionContext]]
and any `ExecutionContext` can be quickly converted into a `Scheduler`.
And then you're off ...

{{{
// scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global
// is being used under the hood
import monix.execution.Scheduler.Implicits.global

// or we can simply convert our own execution context
// import play.api.libs.concurrent.Execution.Implicits.defaultContext
// implicit val scheduler = Scheduler(defaultContext)

import scala.concurrent.duration._
import monix._

val subscription = Observable.intervalAtFixedRate(1.second)
  .take(10)
  .subscription(x => println(x))
}}}

We can then try out more complex things:

{{{
import monix.execution.Scheduler.Implicits.global
import play.api.libs.ws._
import monix._

// emits an auto-incremented number, every second
Observable.interval(1.second)
  // drops the items emitted over the first 5 secs
  .dropByTimespan(5.seconds)
  // takes the first 100 emitted events
  .take(100)
  // per second, makes requests and concatenates the results
  .flatMap(x => WS.request(s"http://some.endpoint.com/request?tick=$x").get())
  // filters only valid responses
  .filter(response => response.status == 200)
  // samples by 3 seconds, repeating previous results in case of nothing new
  .sampleRepeated(3.seconds)
  // processes response, selecting the body
  .map(response => response.body)
  // creates subscription, foreach response print it
  .foreach(x => println(x))
}}}

There's actually a lot more to Monix.
