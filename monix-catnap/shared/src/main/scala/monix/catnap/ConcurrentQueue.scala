/**
  * A high-performance, back-pressured, generic concurrent queue implementation.
  *
  * This is the pure and generic version of [[monix.execution.AsyncQueue]].
  *
  * ==Example==
  *
  * {{{

  *

  *   implicit val cs: ContextShift[IO] = SchedulerEffect.contextShift[IO](global)(IO.ioEffect)
  *   // We need a `Timer` for this to work
  *   implicit val timer: Timer[IO] = SchedulerEffect.timer[IO](global)
  *
  *   def consumer(queue: ConcurrentQueue[IO, Int], index: Int): IO[Unit] =
  *     queue.poll.flatMap { a =>
  *       println(s"Worker $$index: $$a")
  *       consumer(queue, index)
  *     }
  *
  *   for {
  *     queue     <- ConcurrentQueue[IO].bounded[Int](capacity = 32)
  *     consumer1 <- consumer(queue, 1).start
  *     consumer2 <- consumer(queue, 1).start
  *     // Pushing some samples
  *     _         <- queue.offer(1)

  *     _         <- queue.offer(3)
  *     // Stopping the consumer loops
  *     _         <- consumer1.cancel
  *     _         <- consumer2.cancel
  *   } yield ()
  * }}}
  *
  * ==Back-Pressuring and the Polling Model==
  *
  * The initialized queue can be limited to a maximum buffer size, a size
  * that could be rounded to a power of 2, so you can't rely on it to be
  * precise. Such a bounded queue can be initialized via
  * [[monix.catnap.ConcurrentQueue.bounded ConcurrentQueue.bounded]].
  * Also see [[monix.execution.BufferCapacity BufferCapacity]], the
  * configuration parameter that can be passed in the
  * [[monix.catnap.ConcurrentQueue.withConfig ConcurrentQueue.withConfig]]
  * builder.
  *
  * On [[offer]], when the queue is full, the implementation back-pressures
  * until the queue has room again in its internal buffer, the task being
  * completed when the value was pushed successfully. Similarly [[poll]] awaits
  * the queue to have items in it. This works for both bounded and unbounded queues.
  *
  * For both `offer` and `poll`, in case awaiting a result happens, the
  * implementation does so asynchronously, without any threads being blocked.
  *
  * ==Multi-threading Scenario==
  *
  * This queue supports a [[monix.execution.ChannelType ChannelType]]
  * configuration, for fine tuning depending on the needed multi-threading
  * scenario. And this can yield better performance:
  *
  *   - [[monix.execution.ChannelType.MPMC MPMC]]:
  *     multi-producer, multi-consumer
  *   - [[monix.execution.ChannelType.MPSC MPSC]]:
  *     multi-producer, single-consumer
  *   - [[monix.execution.ChannelType.SPMC SPMC]]:
  *     single-producer, multi-consumer
  *   - [[monix.execution.ChannelType.SPSC SPSC]]:
  *     single-producer, single-consumer
  *
  * The default is `MPMC`, because that's the safest scenario.
  *
  * {{{
  *   import monix.execution.ChannelType.MPSC
  *   import monix.execution.BufferCapacity.Bounded
  *
  *   val queue = ConcurrentQueue[IO].withConfig[Int](
  *     capacity = Bounded(128),
  *     channelType = MPSC
  *   )
  * }}}
  *
  * '''WARNING''': default is `MPMC`, however any other scenario implies
  * a relaxation of the internal synchronization between threads.
  *
  * This means that using the wrong scenario can lead to severe
  * concurrency bugs. If you're not sure what multi-threading scenario you
  * have, then just stick with the default `MPMC`.
