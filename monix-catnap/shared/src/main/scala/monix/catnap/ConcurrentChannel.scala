/**
  * `ConcurrentChannel` can be used to model complex producer-consumer communication channels.
  *
  * It exposes these fundamental operations:
  *
  *  - [[push]] for pushing single events to consumers (producer side)
  *  - [[pushMany]] for pushing event sequences to consumers (producer side)
  *  - [[halt]] for pushing the final completion event to all consumers (producer side)
  *  - [[consume]] for creating a [[ConsumerF]] value that can consume the
  *    incoming events from the channel
  *
  * ==Example==

  *     _ <- consumers_3_4.join
  *   } yield ()
  * }}}
  *
  * ==Unicasting vs Broadcasting vs Multicasting==
  *
  * ''Unicasting'': A communication channel between one producer and one
  * [[ConsumerF]]. Multiple workers can share the load of processing
  * incoming events. For example in case we want to have 8 workers running in
  * parallel, you can create one [[ConsumerF]], via [[consume]] and then use it
  * for multiple workers. Internally this setup uses a single queue and whatever
  * workers you have will share it.
  *
  * ''Broadcasting:'' the same events can be sent to multiple consumers,
  * thus duplicating the load, as a broadcasting setup can be created
  * by creating and consuming from multiple [[ConsumerF]] via multiple calls
  * to [[consume]]. Internally each `ConsumerF` gets its own queue and hence
  * messages are duplicated.
  *
  * ''Multicasting:'' multiple producers can push events at the same time,
  * provided the channel's type is configured as a
  * [[monix.execution.ChannelType.MultiProducer MultiProducer]].
  *
  * ==Back-Pressuring and the Polling Model==
  *
  * When consumers get created via [[consume]], a buffer gets created and
  * assigned per consumer.
  *
  * Depending on what the [[monix.execution.BufferCapacity BufferCapacity]]
  * is configured to be, the initialized consumer can work with a maximum
  * buffer size, a size that could be rounded to a power of 2, so you can't
  * rely on it to be precise. See [[consumeWithConfig]] for customizing this
  * buffer on a per-consumer basis, or the
  * [[monix.catnap.ConcurrentChannel.withConfig ConcurrentChannel.withConfig]]
  * builder for setting the default used in [[consume]].
  *
  * On [[push]], when the queue is full, the implementation back-pressures
  * until the channel has room again in its internal buffer(s), the task being
  * completed when the value was pushed successfully. Similarly [[ConsumerF.pull]]
  * (returned by [[consume]]) awaits the channel to have items in it. This
  * works for both bounded and unbounded channels.
  *
  * For both `push` and `pull`, in case awaiting a result happens, the
  * implementation does so asynchronously, without any threads being blocked.
  *
  * ==Multi-threading Scenario==
  *
  * This channel supports the fine-tuning of the concurrency scenario via
  * [[monix.execution.ChannelType.ProducerSide ChannelType.ProducerSide]]
  * (see [[monix.catnap.ConcurrentChannel.withConfig ConcurrentChannel.withConfig]])
  * and the
  * [[monix.execution.ChannelType.ConsumerSide ChannelType.ConsumerSide]]
  * that can be specified per consumer (see [[consumeWithConfig]]).
  *
  * The default is set to
  * [[monix.execution.ChannelType.MultiProducer MultiProducer]] and
  * [[monix.execution.ChannelType.MultiConsumer MultiConsumer]], which is always
  * the safe choice, however these can be customized for better performance.
  *
  * These scenarios are available:
  *
  *   - [[monix.execution.ChannelType.MPMC MPMC]]:
  *     multi-producer, multi-consumer, when
  *     [[monix.execution.ChannelType.MultiProducer MultiProducer]]
  *     is selected on the channel's creation and
  *     [[monix.execution.ChannelType.MultiConsumer MultiConsumer]] is
  *     selected when [[consume consuming]]; this is the safe scenario and
  *     should be used as the default, especially when in doubt
  *   - [[monix.execution.ChannelType.MPSC MPSC]]:
  *     multi-producer, single-consumer, when
  *     [[monix.execution.ChannelType.MultiProducer MultiProducer]]
  *     is selected on the channel's creation and
  *     [[monix.execution.ChannelType.SingleConsumer SingleConsumer]] is
  *     selected when [[consume consuming]]; this scenario should be selected
  *     when there are multiple producers, but a single worker that consumes
  *     data sequentially (per [[ConsumerF]]); note that this means a single
  *     worker per [[ConsumerF]] instance, but you can still have multiple
  *     [[ConsumerF]] instances created, , because each [[ConsumerF]] gets its
  *     own buffer anyway
  *   - [[monix.execution.ChannelType.SPMC SPMC]]:
  *     single-producer, multi-consumer, when
  *     [[monix.execution.ChannelType.SingleProducer SingleProducer]]
  *     is selected on the channel's creation and
  *     [[monix.execution.ChannelType.MultiConsumer MultiConsumer]] is
  *     selected when [[consume consuming]]; this scenario should be selected
  *     when there are multiple workers processing data in parallel
  *     (e.g. pulling from the same [[ConsumerF]]), but a single producer that
  *     pushes data on the channel sequentially
  *   - [[monix.execution.ChannelType.SPSC SPSC]]:
  *     single-producer, single-consumer, when
  *     [[monix.execution.ChannelType.SingleProducer SingleProducer]]
  *     is selected on the channel's creation and
  *     [[monix.execution.ChannelType.SingleConsumer SingleConsumer]] is
  *     selected when [[consume consuming]]; this scenario should be selected
  *     when there is a single producer that pushes data on the channel
  *     sequentially and a single worker per [[ConsumerF]] instance that
  *     pulls data from the channel sequentially; note you can still have
  *     multiple [[ConsumerF]] instances running in parallel, because
  *     each [[ConsumerF]] gets its own buffer anyway
  *
  * The default is `MPMC`, because that's the safest scenario.
  *
  * {{{
  *   import cats.implicits._
  *   import cats.effect.IO
  *   import monix.execution.ChannelType.{SingleProducer, SingleConsumer}
  *   import monix.execution.BufferCapacity.Bounded
  *
  *   val channel = ConcurrentChannel[IO].withConfig[Int, Int](
  *     producerType = SingleProducer
  *   )
  *
  *   val consumerConfig = ConsumerF.Config(
  *     consumerType = Some(SingleConsumer)
  *   )
  *
  *   for {
  *     producer  <- channel
  *     consumer1 =  producer.consumeWithConfig(consumerConfig)
  *     consumer2 =  producer.consumeWithConfig(consumerConfig)
  *     fiber1    <- consumer1.use { ref => ref.pull }.start
  *     fiber2    <- consumer2.use { ref => ref.pull }.start

  *     value2    <- fiber2.join
  *   } yield {
  *     (value1, value2)
  *   }
  * }}}
  *
  * Note that in this example, even if we used `SingleConsumer` as the type
  * passed in [[consumeWithConfig]], we can still consume from two [[ConsumerF]]
  * instances at the same time, because each one gets its own internal buffer.
  * But you cannot have multiple workers per [[ConsumerF]] in this scenario,
  * because this would break the internal synchronization / visibility
  * guarantees.
  *
  * '''WARNING''': default is `MPMC`, however any other scenario implies
  * a relaxation of the internal synchronization between threads.
  *
  * This means that using the wrong scenario can lead to severe
  * concurrency bugs. If you're not sure what multi-threading scenario you
  * have, then just stick with the default `MPMC`.
  *
  * ==Credits==
  *
  * Inspired by Haskell's
  * [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base/docs/Control-Concurrent-ConcurrentChannel.html Control.Concurrent.ConcurrentChannel]],
  * but note that this isn't a straight port — e.g. the Monix implementation has a
  * cleaner, non-leaky interface, is back-pressured and allows for termination
  * (via [[halt]]), which changes its semantics significantly.
