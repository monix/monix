 *      onNext *   (onComplete | onError)?
 *
 * That means an Observer can receive zero or multiple events, the stream
 * ending either in one or zero `onComplete` or `onError` (just one, not both),
 * and after onComplete or onError, a well behaved Observable implementation
 * shouldn't send any more onNext events.
