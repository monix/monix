/** `Task` represents a specification for a possibly lazy or
  * asynchronous computation, which when executed will produce an `A`
  * as a result, along with possible side-effects.
  *
  * Compared with `Future` from Scala's standard library, `Task` does
  * not represent a running computation or a value detached from time,
  * as `Task` does not execute anything when working with its builders
  * or operators and it does not submit any work into any thread-pool,
  * the execution eventually taking place only after `runAsync` is
  * called and not before that.
  *
  * Note that `Task` is conservative in how it spawns logical threads.
  * Transformations like `map` and `flatMap` for example will default
  * to being executed on the logical thread on which the asynchronous
  * computation was started. But one shouldn't make assumptions about
  * how things will end up executed, as ultimately it is the
  * implementation's job to decide on the best execution model. All
  * you are guaranteed is asynchronous execution after executing
  * `runAsync`.
  *
  * =Getting Started=
  *
  * To build a `Task` from a by-name parameters (thunks), we can use
  * [[monix.eval.Task.apply Task.apply]] (
  * alias [[monix.eval.Task.eval Task.eval]]) or
  * [[monix.eval.Task.evalAsync Task.evalAsync]]:
  *
  * {{{
  *   val hello = Task("Hello ")
  *   val world = Task.evalAsync("World!")
  * }}}
  *
  * Nothing gets executed yet, as `Task` is lazy, nothing executes
  * until you trigger its evaluation via [[Task!.runAsync runAsync]] or
  * [[Task!.runToFuture runToFuture]].
  *
  * To combine `Task` values we can use [[Task!.map .map]] and
  * [[Task!.flatMap .flatMap]], which describe sequencing and this time
  * it's in a very real sense because of the laziness involved:
  *
  * {{{
  *   val sayHello = hello
  *     .flatMap(h => world.map(w => h + w))
  *     .map(println)
  * }}}
  *
  * This `Task` reference will trigger a side effect on evaluation, but
  * not yet. To make the above print its message:
  *
  * {{{
  *   import monix.execution.CancelableFuture
  *   import monix.execution.Scheduler.Implicits.global
  *
  *   val f: CancelableFuture[Unit] = sayHello.runToFuture
  *   // => Hello World!
  * }}}
  *
  * The returned type is a
  * [[monix.execution.CancelableFuture CancelableFuture]] which
  * inherits from Scala's standard [[scala.concurrent.Future Future]],
  * a value that can be completed already or might be completed at
  * some point in the future, once the running asynchronous process
  * finishes. Such a future value can also be canceled, see below.
  *
  * =Laziness, Purity and Referential Transparency=
  *
  * The fact that `Task` is lazy whereas `Future` is not
  * has real consequences. For example with `Task` you can do this:
  *
  * {{{
  *   import scala.concurrent.duration._
  *
  *   def retryOnFailure[A](times: Int, source: Task[A]): Task[A] =
  *     source.onErrorHandleWith { err =>
  *       // No more retries left? Re-throw error:
  *       if (times <= 0) Task.raiseError(err) else {
  *         // Recursive call, yes we can!
  *         retryOnFailure(times - 1, source)
  *           // Adding 500 ms delay for good measure
  *           .delayExecution(500.millis)
  *       }
  *     }
  * }}}
  *
  * `Future` being a strict value-wannabe means that the actual value
  * gets "memoized" (means cached), however `Task` is basically a function
  * that can be repeated for as many times as you want.
  *
  * `Task` is a pure data structure that can be used to describe
  * pure functions, the equivalent of Haskell's `IO`.
  *
  * ==Memoization==
  *
  * `Task` can also do memoization, making it behave like a "lazy"
  * Scala `Future`, meaning that nothing is started yet, its
  * side effects being evaluated on the first `runAsync` and then
  * the result reused on subsequent evaluations:
  *
  * {{{
  *   Task(println("boo")).memoize
  * }}}
  *
  * The difference between this and just calling `runAsync()` is that
  * `memoize()` still returns a `Task` and the actual memoization
  * happens on the first `runAsync()` (with idempotency guarantees of
  * course).
  *
  * But here's something else that the `Future` data type cannot do,
  * [[monix.eval.Task!.memoizeOnSuccess memoizeOnSuccess]]:
  *
  * {{{
  *   Task.eval {
  *     if (scala.util.Random.nextDouble() > 0.33)
  *       throw new RuntimeException("error!")
  *     println("moo")
  *   }.memoizeOnSuccess
  * }}}
  *
  * This keeps repeating the computation for as long as the result is a
  * failure and caches it only on success. Yes we can!
  *
  * ''WARNING:'' as awesome as `memoize` can be, use with care
  * because memoization can break referential transparency!
  *
  * ==Parallelism==
  *
  * Because of laziness, invoking
  * [[monix.eval.Task.sequence Task.sequence]] will not work like
  * it does for `Future.sequence`, the given `Task` values being
  * evaluated one after another, in ''sequence'', not in ''parallel''.
  * If you want parallelism, then you need to use
  * [[monix.eval.Task.parSequence Task.parSequence]] and thus be explicit about it.
  *
  * This is great because it gives you the possibility of fine tuning the
  * execution. For example, say you want to execute things in parallel,
  * but with a maximum limit of 30 tasks being executed in parallel.
  * One way of doing that is to process your list in batches:
  *
  * {{{
  *   // Some array of tasks, you come up with something good :-)
  *   val list: Seq[Task[Int]] = Seq.tabulate(100)(Task(_))
  *
  *   // Split our list in chunks of 30 items per chunk,
  *   // this being the maximum parallelism allowed
  *   val chunks = list.sliding(30, 30).toSeq
  *
  *   // Specify that each batch should process stuff in parallel
  *   val batchedTasks = chunks.map(chunk => Task.parSequence(chunk))
  *   // Sequence the batches
  *   val allBatches = Task.sequence(batchedTasks)
  *
  *   // Flatten the result, within the context of Task
  *   val all: Task[Seq[Int]] = allBatches.map(_.flatten)
  * }}}
  *
  * Note that the built `Task` reference is just a specification at
  * this point, or you can view it as a function, as nothing has
  * executed yet, you need to call [[Task!.runAsync runAsync]]
  * or [[Task!.runToFuture runToFuture]] explicitly.
  *
  * =Cancellation=
  *
  * The logic described by an `Task` task could be cancelable,
  * depending on how the `Task` gets built.
  *
  * [[monix.execution.CancelableFuture CancelableFuture]] references
  * can also be canceled, in case the described computation can be
  * canceled. When describing `Task` tasks with `Task.eval` nothing
  * can be cancelled, since there's nothing about a plain function
  * that you can cancel, but we can build cancelable tasks with
  * [[monix.eval.Task.cancelable0[A](register* Task.cancelable]].
  *
  * {{{
  *   import scala.concurrent.duration._
  *   import scala.util._
  *
  *   val delayedHello = Task.cancelable0[Unit] { (scheduler, callback) =>
  *     val task = scheduler.scheduleOnce(1.second) {
  *       println("Delayed Hello!")
  *       // Signaling successful completion
  *       callback(Success(()))
  *     }
  *     // Returning a cancel token that knows how to cancel the
  *     // scheduled computation:
  *     Task {
  *       println("Cancelling!")
  *       task.cancel()
  *     }
  *   }
  * }}}
  *
  * The sample above prints a message with a delay, where the delay
  * itself is scheduled with the injected `Scheduler`. The `Scheduler`
  * is in fact an implicit parameter to `runAsync()`.
  *
  * This action can be cancelled, because it specifies cancellation
  * logic. In case we have no cancelable logic to express, then it's
  * OK if we returned a
  * [[monix.execution.Cancelable.empty Cancelable.empty]] reference,
  * in which case the resulting `Task` would not be cancelable.
  *
  * But the `Task` we just described is cancelable, for one at the
  * edge, due to `runAsync` returning [[monix.execution.Cancelable Cancelable]]
  * and [[monix.execution.CancelableFuture CancelableFuture]] references:
  *
  * {{{
  *   // Triggering execution
  *   val cf: CancelableFuture[Unit] = delayedHello.runToFuture
  *
  *   // If we change our mind before the timespan has passed:
  *   cf.cancel()
  * }}}
  *
  * But also cancellation is described on `Task` as a pure action,
  * which can be used for example in [[monix.eval.Task.race race]] conditions:
  *
  * {{{
  *   import scala.concurrent.duration._
  *   import scala.concurrent.TimeoutException
  *
  *   val ta = Task(1 + 1).delayExecution(4.seconds)
  *
  *   val tb = Task.raiseError[Int](new TimeoutException)
  *     .delayExecution(4.seconds)
  *
  *   Task.racePair(ta, tb).flatMap {
  *     case Left((a, fiberB)) =>
  *       fiberB.cancel.map(_ => a)
  *     case Right((fiberA, b)) =>
  *       fiberA.cancel.map(_ => b)
  *   }
  * }}}
  *
  * The returned type in `racePair` is [[Fiber]], which is a data
  * type that's meant to wrap tasks linked to an active process
  * and that can be [[Fiber.cancel canceled]] or [[Fiber.join joined]].
  *
  * Also, given a task, we can specify actions that need to be
  * triggered in case of cancellation, see
  * [[monix.eval.Task!.doOnCancel doOnCancel]]:
  *
  * {{{
  *   val task = Task.eval(println("Hello!")).executeAsync
  *
  *   task doOnCancel Task.eval {
  *     println("A cancellation attempt was made!")
  *   }
  * }}}
  *
  * Given a task, we can also create a new task from it that atomic
  * (non cancelable), in the sense that either all of it executes
  * or nothing at all, via [[monix.eval.Task!.uncancelable uncancelable]].
  *
  * =Note on the ExecutionModel=
  *
  * `Task` is conservative in how it introduces async boundaries.
  * Transformations like `map` and `flatMap` for example will default
  * to being executed on the current call stack on which the
  * asynchronous computation was started. But one shouldn't make
  * assumptions about how things will end up executed, as ultimately
  * it is the implementation's job to decide on the best execution
  * model. All you are guaranteed (and can assume) is asynchronous
  * execution after executing `runAsync`.
  *
  * Currently the default
  * [[monix.execution.ExecutionModel ExecutionModel]] specifies
  * batched execution by default and `Task` in its evaluation respects
  * the injected `ExecutionModel`. If you want a different behavior,
  * you need to execute the `Task` reference with a different scheduler.
  *
  * @define schedulerDesc is an injected
  *         [[monix.execution.Scheduler Scheduler]] that gets used
  *         whenever asynchronous boundaries are needed when
  *         evaluating the task; a `Scheduler` is in general needed
  *         when the `Task` needs to be evaluated via `runAsync`
  *
  * @define schedulerEvalDesc is the
  *         [[monix.execution.Scheduler Scheduler]] needed in order
  *         to evaluate the source, being required in Task's
  *         [[runAsync]], [[runAsyncF]] or [[runToFuture]].
  *
  * @define callbackDesc ==Callback==
  *
  *         When executing the task via this method, the user is
  *         required to supply a side effecting callback with the
  *         signature: `Either[Throwable, A] => Unit`.
  *
  *         This will be used by the implementation to signal completion,
  *         signaling either a `Right(value)` or a `Left(error)`.
  *
  *         `Task` however uses [[monix.execution.Callback Callback]]
  *         internally, so you can supply a `Callback` instance instead
  *         and it will be used to avoid unnecessary boxing. It also has
  *         handy utilities.
  *
  *         Note that with `Callback` you can:
  *
  *          - convert from a plain function using `Either[Throwable, A]` as input via
  *            [[monix.execution.Callback.fromAttempt Callback.fromAttempt]]
  *          - convert from a plain function using `Try[A]` as input via
  *            [[monix.execution.Callback.fromTry Callback.fromTry]]
  *          - wrap a standard Scala `Promise` via
  *            [[monix.execution.Callback.fromPromise Callback.fromPromise]]
  *          - pass an empty callback that just reports errors via
  *            [[monix.execution.Callback.empty Callback.empty]]
  *
  * @define callbackParamDesc is a callback that will be invoked upon
  *         completion, either with a successful result, or with an error;
  *         note that you can use [[monix.execution.Callback]] for extra
  *         performance (avoids the boxing in [[scala.Either]])
  *
  * @define cancelableDesc a [[monix.execution.Cancelable Cancelable]]
  *         that can be used to cancel a running task
  *
  * @define cancelTokenDesc a `Task[Unit]`, aliased via Cats-Effect
  *         as a `CancelToken[Task]`, that can be used to cancel the
  *         running task. Given that this is a `Task`, it can describe
  *         asynchronous finalizers (if the source had any), therefore
  *         users can apply back-pressure on the completion of such
  *         finalizers.
  *
  * @define optionsDesc a set of [[monix.eval.Task.Options Options]]
  *         that determine the behavior of Task's run-loop.
  *
  * @define startInspiration Inspired by
  *         [[https://github.com/functional-streams-for-scala/fs2 FS2]],
  *         with the difference that this method does not fork
  *         automatically, being consistent with Monix's default
  *         behavior.
  *
  * @define runSyncUnsafeTimeout is a duration that specifies the
  *         maximum amount of time that this operation is allowed to block the
  *         underlying thread. If the timeout expires before the result is ready,
  *         a `TimeoutException` gets thrown. Note that you're allowed to
  *         pass an infinite duration (with `Duration.Inf`), but unless
  *         it's `main` that you're blocking and unless you're doing it only
  *         once, then this is definitely not recommended — provide a finite
  *         timeout in order to avoid deadlocks.
  *
  * @define runSyncUnsafePermit is an implicit value that's only available for
  *         the JVM and not for JavaScript, its purpose being to stop usage of
  *         this operation on top of engines that do not support blocking threads.
  *
  * @define runSyncMaybeReturn `Right(result)` in case a result was processed,
  *         or `Left(future)` in case an asynchronous boundary
  *         was hit and further async execution is needed
  *
  * @define runSyncStepReturn `Right(result)` in case a result was processed,
  *         or `Left(task)` in case an asynchronous boundary
  *         was hit and further async execution is needed
  *
  * @define runAsyncToFutureReturn a
  *         [[monix.execution.CancelableFuture CancelableFuture]]
  *         that can be used to extract the result or to cancel
  *         a running task.
  *
  * @define bracketErrorNote '''NOTE on error handling''': one big
  *         difference versus `try {} finally {}` is that, in case
  *         both the `release` function and the `use` function throws,
  *         the error raised by `use` gets signaled and the error
  *         raised by `release` gets reported with `System.err` for
  *         [[Coeval]] or with
  *         [[monix.execution.Scheduler.reportFailure Scheduler.reportFailure]]
  *         for [[Task]].
  *
  *         For example:
  *
  *         {{{
  *           Task.evalAsync("resource").bracket { _ =>
  *             // use
  *             Task.raiseError(new RuntimeException("Foo"))
  *           } { _ =>
  *             // release
  *             Task.raiseError(new RuntimeException("Bar"))
  *           }
  *         }}}
  *
  *         In this case the error signaled downstream is `"Foo"`,
  *         while the `"Bar"` error gets reported. This is consistent
  *         with the behavior of Haskell's `bracket` operation and NOT
  *         with `try {} finally {}` from Scala, Java or JavaScript.
  *
  * @define unsafeRun '''UNSAFE (referential transparency)''' —
  *         this operation can trigger the execution of side effects, which
  *         breaks referential transparency and is thus not a pure function.
  *
  *         Normally these functions shouldn't be called until
  *         "the end of the world", which is to say at the end of
  *         the program (for a console app), or at the end of a web
  *         request (in case you're working with a web framework or
  *         toolkit that doesn't provide good integration with Monix's
  *         `Task` via Cats-Effect).
  *
  *         Otherwise for modifying or operating on tasks, prefer
  *         its pure functions like `map` and `flatMap`.
  *         In FP code don't use `runAsync`. Remember that `Task`
  *         is not a 1:1 replacement for `Future`, `Task` being
  *         a very different abstraction.
  *
  * @define memoizeCancel '''Cancellation''' — a memoized task will mirror
  *         the behavior of the source on cancellation. This means that:
  *
  *          - if the source isn't cancellable, then the resulting memoized
  *            task won't be cancellable either
  *          - if the source is cancellable, then the memoized task can be
  *            cancelled, which can take unprepared users by surprise
  *
  *         Depending on use-case, there are two ways to ensure no surprises:
  *
  *          - usage of [[onCancelRaiseError]], before applying memoization, to
  *            ensure that on cancellation an error is triggered and then noticed
  *            by the memoization logic
  *          - usage of [[uncancelable]], either before or after applying
  *            memoization, to ensure that the memoized task cannot be cancelled
  *
  * @define memoizeUnsafe '''UNSAFE''' — this operation allocates a shared,
  *         mutable reference, which can break in certain cases
  *         referential transparency, even if this operation guarantees
  *         idempotency (i.e. referential transparency implies idempotency,
  *         but idempotency does not imply referential transparency).
  *
  *         The allocation of a mutable reference is known to be a
  *         side effect, thus breaking referential transparency,
  *         even if calling this method does not trigger the evaluation
  *         of side effects suspended by the source.
  *
  *         Use with care. Sometimes it's easier to just keep a shared,
  *         memoized reference to some connection, but keep in mind
  *         it might be better to pass such a reference around as
  *         a parameter.

    * Some implementation details:
    *
    *  - blocking the underlying thread is done by triggering Scala's
    *    `BlockingContext` (`scala.concurrent.blocking`), just like
    *    Scala's `Await.result`
    *  - the `timeout` is mandatory, just like when using Scala's
    *    `Await.result`, in order to make the caller aware that the
    *    operation is dangerous and that setting a `timeout` is good
    *    practice
    *  - the loop starts in an execution mode that ignores
    *    [[monix.execution.ExecutionModel.BatchedExecution BatchedExecution]] or
    *    [[monix.execution.ExecutionModel.AlwaysAsyncExecution AlwaysAsyncExecution]],
    *    until the first asynchronous boundary. This is because we want to block
    *    the underlying thread for the result, in which case preserving
    *    fairness by forcing (batched) async boundaries doesn't do us any good,
    *    quite the contrary, the underlying thread being stuck until the result
    *    is available or until the timeout exception gets triggered.
    *
    * Not supported on top of JavaScript engines and trying to use it
    * with Scala.js will trigger a compile time error.

    * {{{

    * Also note that overriding the "default" scheduler can only
    * happen once, because it's only the "default" that can be

  *         that can be used for managing asynchronous boundaries, a
  *         scheduler being nothing more than an evolved `ExecutionContext`.
  *
  * @define shiftDesc For example we can introduce an
  *         asynchronous boundary in the `flatMap` chain before a
  *         certain task, this being literally the implementation of
  *         [[Task.executeAsync executeAsync]]:
  *
  *         {{{
  *           val task = Task.eval(35)
  *
  *           Task.shift.flatMap(_ => task)
  *         }}}
  *
  *         And this can also be described with `*>` from Cats:
  *
  *         {{{
  *           import cats.syntax.all._
  *
  *           Task.shift *> task
  *         }}}
  *
  *         Or we can specify an asynchronous boundary ''after''
  *         the evaluation of a certain task, this being literally
  *         the implementation of
  *         [[Task!.asyncBoundary:monix\.eval\.Task[A]* .asyncBoundary]]:
  *
  *         {{{
  *           task.flatMap(a => Task.shift.map(_ => a))
  *         }}}
  *
  *         And again we can also describe this with `<*`
  *         from Cats:
  *
  *         {{{
  *           task <* Task.shift
  *         }}}
  *
  * @define parallelismNote NOTE: the tasks get forked automatically so there's
  *         no need to force asynchronous execution for immediate tasks,
  *         parallelism being guaranteed when multi-threading is available!
  *
  *         All specified tasks get evaluated in parallel, regardless of their
  *         execution model ([[Task.eval]] vs [[Task.evalAsync]] doesn't matter).
  *         Also the implementation tries to be smart about detecting forked
  *         tasks so it can eliminate extraneous forks for the very obvious
  *         cases.
  *
  * @define parallelismAdvice ADVICE: In a real life scenario the tasks should
  *         be expensive in order to warrant parallel execution. Parallelism
  *         doesn't magically speed up the code - it's usually fine for I/O-bound
  *         tasks, however for CPU-bound tasks it can make things worse.
  *         Performance improvements need to be verified.
