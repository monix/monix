/** A `StackedObservable` is an [[Observable]] type used in operators that
  * end up being used in loops and that need to be memory safe
  * (e.g. `++`, `suspend`).
  *
  * This is achieved with the same trick used in the [[monix.eval.Task]]
  * implementation. The problem with recursive operators is that they
  * are leaving work behind due to the need to return a `Cancelable`
  * and thus leak memory.
  *
  * As a general rule of thumb, not all observables can be chain-able.
  * For example if the received `Subscriber` gets wrapped in another
  * subscriber instance, then chaining will not be safe unless
  * the `onNext`, `onError` and `onComplete` events introduce
  * asynchronous boundaries as well, which is overkill.
