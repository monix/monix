/** The `Iterant` is a type that describes lazy, possibly asynchronous
  * streaming of elements using a pull-based protocol.
  *
  * It is similar somewhat in spirit to Scala's own
  * `collection.immutable.Stream` and with Java's `Iterable`, except
  * that it is more composable and more flexible due to evaluation being
  * controlled by an `F[_]` monadic type that you have to supply
  * (like `monix.eval.Task`, `monix.eval.Coeval` or
  * `cats.effect.IO`) which will control the evaluation. In other words,
  * this `Iterant` type is capable of strict or lazy, synchronous or
  * asynchronous evaluation.
  *
  * Consumption of an `Iterant` happens typically in a loop where
  * the current step represents either a signal that the stream
  * is over, or a (head, rest) pair, very similar in spirit to
  * Scala's standard `List` or `Iterable`.
  *
  * The type is an ADT, meaning a composite of the following types:
  *
  *  - [[monix.tail.Iterant.Next Next]] which signals a single strict
  *    element, the `head` and a `rest` representing the rest of the stream
  *
  *  - [[monix.tail.Iterant.NextBatch NextBatch]] is a variation on `Next`
  *    for signaling a whole batch of elements by means of a
  *    [[monix.tail.batches.Batch Batch]], a type that's similar with
  *    Scala's `Iterable`, along with the `rest` of the stream.
  *
  *  - [[monix.tail.Iterant.NextCursor NextCursor]] is a variation on `Next`
  *    for signaling a whole strict batch of elements as a traversable
  *    [[monix.tail.batches.BatchCursor BatchCursor]], a type that's similar
  *    with Scala's `Iterator`, along with the `rest` of the stream.
  *
  *  - [[monix.tail.Iterant.Suspend Suspend]] is for suspending the
  *    evaluation of a stream.
  *
  *  - [[monix.tail.Iterant.Concat Concat]] represents the concatenation
  *    of two streams.
  *
  *  - [[monix.tail.Iterant.Scope Scope]] is to specify the acquisition
  *    and release of resources. It is effectively the encoding of
  *    [[https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/typeclasses/bracket.html Bracket]].
  *
  *  - [[monix.tail.Iterant.Halt Halt]] represents an empty stream,
  *    signaling the end, either in success or in error.
  *
  *  - [[monix.tail.Iterant.Last Last]] represents a one-element
  *    stream, where `Last(item)` as an optimisation on
  *    `Next(item, F.pure(Halt(None)), F.unit)`.
  *
  * ==Parametric Polymorphism==
  *
  * The `Iterant` type accepts as type parameter an `F` monadic type
  * that is used to control how evaluation happens. For example you can
  * use `monix.eval.Task`, in which case the streaming can have
  * asynchronous behavior, or you can use `monix.eval.Coeval`
  * in which case it can behave like a normal, synchronous `Iterable`.
  *
  * As restriction, this `F[_]` type used should be stack safe in
  * `map` and `flatMap`, otherwise you might get stack-overflow
  * exceptions. This is why in general the type class required
  * for `F` is `cats.effect.Sync`.
  *
  * When building instances, type `F[_]` which handles the evaluation
  * needs to be specified upfront. Example:
  *
  * {{{
  *   import cats.effect.IO
  *   import monix.eval.{Task, Coeval}
  *
  *   // Builds an Iterant powered by Monix's Task
  *   Iterant[Task].of(1, 2, 3)
  *
  *   // Builds an Iterant powered by Monix's Coeval
  *   Iterant[Coeval].of(1, 2, 3)
  *
  *   // Builds an Iterant powered by Cats's IO
  *   Iterant[IO].of(1, 2, 3)
  * }}}
  *
  * You'll usually pick between `Task`, `Coeval` or `IO` for your
  * needs.
  *
  * ==Attribution==
  *
  * This type was inspired by the `Streaming` type in the
  * [[https://typelevel.org/cats/ Typelevel Cats]] library (later moved
  * to [[https://github.com/stew/dogs Dogs]]), originally committed in
  * Cats by Erik Osheim. It was also inspired by other push-based
  * streaming abstractions, like the `Iteratee` or `IAsyncEnumerable`.
  *
  * @tparam F is the data type that controls evaluation; note that
  *         it must be stack-safe in its `map` and `flatMap`
  *         operations
  *
  * @tparam A is the type of the elements produced by this Iterant
  *
  * @define catsOrderInterop ==Cats Order and Scala Interop==
  *
  *         Monix prefers to work with [[cats.Order]] for assessing the order
  *         of elements that have an ordering defined, instead of
  *         [[scala.math.Ordering]].
  *
  *         We do this for consistency, as Monix is now building on top of Cats.
  *         This may change in the future, depending on what happens with
  *         [[https://github.com/typelevel/cats/issues/2455 typelevel/cats#2455]].
  *
  *         Building a `cats.Order` is easy to do if you already have a
  *         Scala `Ordering` instance:
  *         {{{
  *           import cats.Order
  *
  *           case class Person(name: String, age: Int)
  *
  *           // Starting from a Scala Ordering
  *           implicit val scalaOrderingForPerson: Ordering[Person] =
  *             new Ordering[Person] {
  *               def compare(x: Person, y: Person): Int =
  *                 x.age.compareTo(y.age) match {
  *                   case 0 => x.name.compareTo(y.name)
  *                   case o => o
  *                 }
  *             }
  *
  *           // Building a cats.Order from it
  *           implicit val catsOrderForPerson: Order[Person] =
  *             Order.fromOrdering
  *         }}}
  *
  *         You can also do that in reverse, so you can prefer `cats.Order`
  *         (due to Cats also exposing laws and tests for free) and build a
  *         Scala `Ordering` when needed:
  *         {{{
  *           val scalaOrdering = catsOrderForPerson.toOrdering
  *         }}}
  *
  * @define catsEqInterop ==Cats Eq and Scala Interop==
  *
  *         Monix prefers to work with [[cats.Eq]] for assessing the equality
  *         of elements that have an ordering defined, instead of
  *         [[scala.math.Equiv]].
  *
  *         We do this because Scala's `Equiv` has a default instance defined
  *         that's based on universal equality and that's a big problem, because
  *         when using the `Eq` type class, it is universal equality that we
  *         want to avoid and there have been countless of bugs in the ecosystem
  *         related to both universal equality and `Equiv`. Thankfully people
  *         are working to fix it.
  *
  *         We also do this for consistency, as Monix is now building on top of
  *         Cats. This may change in the future, depending on what happens with
  *         [[https://github.com/typelevel/cats/issues/2455 typelevel/cats#2455]].
  *
  *         Defining `Eq` instance is easy and we can use universal equality
  *         in our definitions as well:
  *         {{{
  *           import cats.Eq
  *
  *           case class Address(host: String, port: Int)
  *
  *           implicit val eqForAddress: Eq[Address] =
  *             Eq.fromUniversalEquals
  *         }}}

  * @define NextDesc The [[monix.tail.Iterant.Next Next]] state
  *         of the [[Iterant]] represents a `item` / `rest`
  *         cons pair, where the head `item` is a strict value.
  *
  *         Note that `item` being a strict value means that it is
  *         already known, whereas the `rest` is meant to be lazy and
  *         can have asynchronous behavior as well, depending on the `F`
  *         type used.
  *
  *         See [[monix.tail.Iterant.NextCursor NextCursor]]
  *         for a state where the head is a strict immutable list.
  *
  * @define NextCursorDesc The [[monix.tail.Iterant.NextCursor NextCursor]] state
  *         of the [[Iterant]] represents an `batch` / `rest` cons pair,
  *         where `batch` is an [[scala.collection.Iterator Iterator]]
  *         type that can generate a whole batch of elements.
  *
  *         Useful for doing buffering, or by giving it an empty iterator,
  *         useful to postpone the evaluation of the next element.
  *
  * @define NextBatchDesc The [[monix.tail.Iterant.NextBatch NextBatch]] state
  *         of the [[Iterant]] represents an `batch` / `rest` cons pair,
  *         where `batch` is an [[scala.collection.Iterable Iterable]]
  *         type that can generate a whole batch of elements.
  *
  * @define SuspendDesc The [[monix.tail.Iterant.Suspend Suspend]] state
  *         of the [[Iterant]] represents a suspended stream to be
  *         evaluated in the `F` context. It is useful to delay the
  *         evaluation of a stream by deferring to `F`.
  *
  * @define ConcatDesc The [[monix.tail.Iterant.Concat Concat]] state
  *         of the [[Iterant]] represents a state that specifies
  *         the concatenation of two streams.
  *
  * @define ScopeDesc The [[monix.tail.Iterant.Scope Scope]] state
  *         of the [[Iterant]] represents a stream that is able to
  *         specify the acquisition and release of a resource, to
  *         be used in generating stream events.
  *
  *         `Scope` is effectively the encoding of
  *         [[https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/typeclasses/bracket.html Bracket]],
  *         necessary for safe handling of resources. The `use`
  *         parameter is supposed to trigger a side effectful action
  *         that allocates resources, which are then used via `use`
  *         and released via `close`.
  *
  *         Note that this is often used in combination with
  *         [[Iterant.Suspend Suspend]] and data types like
  *         [[https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/concurrency/ref.html cats.effect.concurrent.Ref]]
  *         in order to communicate the acquired resources between
  *         `open`, `use` and `close`.
  *
  * @define LastDesc The [[monix.tail.Iterant.Last Last]] state of the
  *         [[Iterant]] represents a completion state as an alternative to
  *         [[monix.tail.Iterant.Halt Halt(None)]], describing one
  *         last element.
  *
  *         It is introduced as an optimization, being equivalent to
  *         `Next(item, F.pure(Halt(None)), F.unit)`, to avoid extra processing
  *         in the monadic `F[_]` and to short-circuit operations such as
  *         concatenation and `flatMap`.
  *
  * @define HaltDesc The [[monix.tail.Iterant.Halt Halt]] state
  *         of the [[Iterant]] represents the completion state
  *         of a stream, with an optional exception if an error
  *         happened.
  *
  *         `Halt` is received as a final state in the iteration process.
  *         This state cannot be followed by any other element and
  *         represents the end of the stream.
  *
  *         @see [[Iterant.Last]] for an alternative that signals one
  *         last item, as an optimisation
  *
  * @define builderSuspendByName Promote a non-strict value representing a
  *         stream to a stream of the same type, effectively delaying
  *         its initialisation.
  *
  * @define headParamDesc is the current element to be signaled
  *
  * @define lastParamDesc is the last element being signaled, after which
  *         the consumer can stop the iteration
  *
  * @define cursorParamDesc is an [[scala.collection.Iterator Iterator]] type
  *         that can generate elements by traversing a collection, a standard
  *         array or any `Iterator`
  *
  * @define generatorParamDesc is a [[scala.collection.Iterable Iterable]]
  *         type that can generate elements by traversing a collection,
  *         a standard array or any `Iterable`
  *
  * @define restParamDesc is the next state in the sequence that
  *         will produce the rest of the stream when evaluated
  *
  * @define stopParamDesc is a computation to be executed in case
  *         streaming is stopped prematurely, giving it a chance
  *         to do resource cleanup (e.g. close file handles)
  *
  * @define exParamDesc is an error to signal at the end of the stream,
  *        or `None` in case the stream has completed normally
  *
  * @define suspendByNameParam is the by-name parameter that will generate
  *         the stream when evaluated
  *
  * @define openParamDesc is an effect that should allocate necessary
  *         resources to be used in `use` and released in `close`
  *
  * @define useParamDesc is the stream created via this scope
  *
  * @define closeParamDesc is an effect that should deallocate
  *         acquired resources via `open` and that will be executed
  *         no matter what
  *
  * @define concatLhDesc is the left hand side of the concatenation,
  *         to be processed before the right-hand side
  *
  * @define concatRhDesc is the rest of the stream, to be processed
  *         after the left-hand side is
  *
  * @define intervalAtFixedRateDesc Creates an iterant that
  *         emits auto-incremented natural numbers (longs).
  *         at a fixed rate, as given by the specified `period`.
  *         The amount of time it takes to process an incoming
  *         value gets subtracted from provided `period`, thus
  *         created iterant tries to emit events spaced by the
  *         given time interval, regardless of how long further
  *         processing takes
  *
  * @define intervalWithFixedDelayDesc Creates an iterant that
  *         emits auto-incremented natural numbers (longs) spaced
  *         by a given time interval. Starts from 0 with no delay,
  *         after which it emits incremented numbers spaced by the
  *         `period` of time. The given `period` of time acts as a
  *         fixed delay between successive events.
